# Cybersecurity Internship - DeveloperHub Corporation
This repository documents the work completed during my cybersecurity internship. The goal is to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities in a sample web application.

## Project Overview
**Task**: Strengthen the security posture of a user management web application.  
**Duration**: 6 Weeks  
**Tools Used**: OWASP ZAP, Browser Dev Tools, Manual Testing

## Weekly Tasks

### Week 1: Security Assessment
- Set up a mock web application
- Performed vulnerability assessment
- Identified potential issues (XSS, SQLi, weak storage)
- Documented findings and recommendations

Explore the detailed report in [`Week 1: Security Assessment`](./Week-1-Security-Assessment.md)

### Week 2: Security Measures Implementation
This report summarizes the security enhancements applied to a simple user management web application, addressing identified vulnerabilities.
#### Vulnerabilities Fixed:
- XSS: Input sanitization and validation implemented using validator.js.
- Weak Password Storage: Passwords are now securely hashed with bcrypt.js.
- Broken Access Control: Routes are protected using jsonwebtoken (JWT) for token-based authentication.
- Insecure HTTP Headers: helmet.js was integrated to add essential security headers.
